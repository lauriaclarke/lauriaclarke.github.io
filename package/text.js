These chewy, melt in your mouth, one-inch squares bring traditional French Pâte de fruit to \n Vermont. You can save the airfare and still savor the experience.\n\n The farm was founded in 2006 on the base of Morrill Mountain\'s North slope to honor the memory of Nanarella\’s son, \n Dana who loved berries. As a family, they spent many hours picking, eating and enjoying delicious time together. \n Nanarella\’s Fruit Pâte is Nanarella\’s way to share the love experienced on those berry-good days.']
