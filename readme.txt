Hi Harpreet,

I've been keeping a lot of stuff that isn't related to MS1 in this GitHub repo, so it's reeeeeaaaally big as a zip file. let me know if this is a problem and I can send you a new version without all the extra stuff in it.

My video is...not what I intended. I will certainly be making a better version for my portfolio over the break. 

Hope you have a nice break!

Best,
Lauria
